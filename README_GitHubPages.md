# Electron Towers — GitHub Pages

This folder contains a single-page app. Upload it to a new GitHub repository and enable Pages.

## Quick Steps

1) Create a new repository on GitHub, e.g. `electron-towers` (Public).
2) Upload **index.html** to the repository root.
3) Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
4) Save. Wait about a minute.
5) Your site will appear at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

If you later update the app, re-upload and commit — Pages redeploys automatically.
